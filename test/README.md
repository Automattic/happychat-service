# Happychat Service Tests

## Integration Tests

These tests boot a fully functional `happychat-service` Socket.IO server and user Socket.IO clients
to completely test features.

## Unit Tests

- Selectors: All `export`ed selectors should have at least one unit test.
- Reducers: There should be at least one unit test for each action state change.
